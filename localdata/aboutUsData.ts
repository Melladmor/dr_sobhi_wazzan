  description:
    "I, Dr. Sobhi Wazzan, hold a PhD in Accounting and have become a leader in the accounting industry by developing new strategies and state-of-the-art solutions to address the challenges businesses face in managing their finances. From an early age, I was fascinated by how companies handle their finances and the intricate flow of money within organizations. This curiosity led me to study accounting in college, where I quickly excelled. My professors soon began seeking my assistance with their own accounting firms, an opportunity I eagerly accepted. Through working alongside my professors and gaining experience in various companies, I developed a deep understanding of all aspects of business operations. I also recognized numerous opportunities to streamline and improve financial processes. This motivated me to establish my own company, Audit Station, to bring these solutions to the broader business world",
